See README.md for generic description + HOWTO.

* TODOs / Plan:
** TODO Cleanup code, publish on github, add license

** Sniffer
*** TODO Sniff for higher layers - IP, etc. And gather additional metadata.
*** TODO Detect automatically outlier packets
*** TODO Intelligent channel hopping / client following
    Aggregating beacons is simple, when sniffing for a client packet
    prelong a visit on a specified channel to sniff more of client
    communication - because of power savings those happen in bursts.
*** TODO I like using timestamps but datetime would probably be better.
** Timetable / knowledge book
*** TODO ESSID tab - all clients calling this essid.
*** TODO Viewing and comparison of presence snapshots, existance in a presence dump
*** TODO Sorting and filtering for time table.
*** TODO Refresh interval selection.
*** DONE Create a service for diagram which shows better information.
*** DONE Knowledge book - page with details on cli/ap
*** DONE Return knowledge as an array, not dict, and sort in different ways.
*** Charts
**** TODO Add time range for strength chart
**** TODO Add refresh button
**** TODO Add graph display of relations.
*** Splitting aggregated data and user data would render optimistic locking not needed.
** Marauder's Map
*** Allow selecting BSSID in Map view and then placing it on map.
*** Localization services for map.
    - Dump place (almost works)
    - Dumped places (show)
    - Add map, change image
    - Show current sniffer localizations
    - IDEA: Rewind history and display different localizations (`seen' on a map)
** TODO Config view
   Allow for changing:
   - Seen algorithm parameters
   - Purge all_frames
   - Get DB stats

** Analyzer
*** Idea: Allow to mark specified time range as a sniffing in a particular location
    Then - automatically mark all bssids as located within this
    localization (home, work, tram, shop)
*** TODO Better mobile detection - sometimes they are both stations and clients.
    And we want them to be treated as clients.
*** TODO `event/Seen' knowledge should contain a context - visible BSSID during seeing.
*** TODO Fix `event/seen' algorithm - nice parametrized filtering.
*** TODO Events should contain stamp of highest signal strength.
*** TODO If more time passed than current_frames keep - use all_frames for initialization automatically

** Map
*** Map image changing / location changing.
*** Point removal
*** Placing Stations by click on the map.


** Logs
*** Display controller on all views on the navbar
